        Hey there! I'm Matt McLean, a biology-minded computer science major studying
        through Oregon State University's post-bacc program. I live in Livermore, Ca
        where I enjoy the local craft brews, play way too many videogames, and occasionally
        venture out to hike the beautiful local Brushy Peak Reserve. My primary
        career interests at the moment are centered around web development and big data.
        I like the tangibility of web development, in that my work produces a final product
        I can point to and explore and admire. However, just the existence of big data
        I find fascinating. The idea that we've amassed such a huge volume of data that we
        cannot handle it with traditional structures is just so cool to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment, I'm looking for a web development internship for Summer of 2017
        to grow my understanding of the full stack work flow and develop the skills needed
        to design and build a user-minded web experience, with an intuitively designed
        front end and a robust and secure back end.
        I have a lot to learn on these fronts, but I'm passionate about the process,
        consuming as much information as I can and incorporating it into my skillset.
        I have yet to take a course on web development (should be this summer of 2017!),
        so I hope to learn from that, but I know the limitations of the classroom
        compared to getting my hands dirty with a real world project.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, please contact me if you're looking for a passionate, hopeful future web developer
        who is ready to get cracking on some fresh web technology!
